## Team

Co-hosted by Tina Lassiter, Jillian Powers, Borhane Blili-Hamelin and Beth Duckles.

The survey research was conducted and analyzed by Tina Lassiter, Mrin Bhattacharya, Jillian Powers, Ian Lowrie (who took point on turning our questions into a crisp survey), Borhane Blili-Hamelin, and Beth Duckles (who built our cross-tabs in R).

Our research data is [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQdX-ZgzXd8Em7aq8mIzn6E88hKUyQmlSuEVkQzr04E/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to share and re-use under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Over the months of February and March 2022, we surveyed over 70 experts to build baseline insights into how folks in different roles think about algorithmic accountability. 

This research is exploratory, and meant to inform the questions we investigate next. That’s why we decided to build a collaborative discussion around our data as our first knowledge sharing step! We can’t wait to explore our data with you all!
