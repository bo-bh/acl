  We started as part of the first cohort of the [MozFest Civil Society Actors for Trustworthy AI in 2021-2022](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/making-trustworthy-ai-real/). 
  
  Decisions made around AI systems need to face adequate scrutiny. However creating an ecosystem of accountability for AI systems is a complex and disorienting puzzle. Our community explores one of the roots of this complexity, the dizzying range of expertise involved: 

  * Disciplines as diverse as policy-making, public administration, law, ethics and social science to design, data science, engineering
  * Subject matter areas as different as data stewardship, biomedical R&D, financial risk modeling, content moderation, labor, human rights law, criminal justice, surveillance, third party auditing, cybersecurity, ML ops, etc. 
  
  We believe that participatory workshops have a place to play in helping the algorithmic accountability community tackle these challenges. 
  
  During our first year, we focused on workshops
  Our solution involves case studies about specific real world AI accountability problems and solutions, but with a twist: we will build the case studies as collaborative events, in which we invite a cross-disciplinary group of participants to co-create strategic insights. Our hope is to build bridges across those expert groups through the experience of targeted, purposeful collaboration. 


  
  During our first year, we conducted
  * 9 public facing participatory events (4 participatory meetups & 5 workshops, including 2 at MozFest 2022 and 1 at RightsCon 2022)
  * A community driven agenda setting process (including identifying, researching case studies, and writing conference applications)
  * 5 rounds of community driven workshop design
  * Exploratory research (qualitative interviews (Dec 2021-Jan 2022); survey research (Feb 2022-March 2022))
